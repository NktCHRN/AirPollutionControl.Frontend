      <h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
      <p>
        Air pollution is the contamination of our atmosphere by harmful substances like gases, particulate matter, and biological materials. 
        It affects our health, environment, and climate. From smoggy cities to rural areas near industrial zones, air pollution knows no boundaries.
